<br />
The script is designed to send daily SMS reminders containing weather updates and Google Calendar events to users.<br />
It allows users to enter their name, city, phone number, and the time they wish to receive messages. <br />
The script fetches weather data from OpenWeatherMap and events from Google Calendar, constructs a message,<br />
and sends it using the pywhatkit library.<br />
